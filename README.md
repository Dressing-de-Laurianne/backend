# Dressing API Project

This project is a Django REST API for managing a virtual wardrobe, built with Django, Django REST Framework and SQLite. It includes a Swagger UI for API exploration and is based on the official Django REST Framework tutorial.

## üöÄ Running with Docker

To start the project in production mode:

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

This will:
- Build the Docker image
- Start the Django app containing the SQLite database
- Run migrations and create an initial superuser (admin/admin)

## üõ†Ô∏è Development with Docker

For development, use the dev compose file to mount your local code and see changes live:

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up --build
```

## üßπ Code Quality with pre-commit

To install and use pre-commit hooks for code quality checks:

```bash
pip install pre-commit
pre-commit install
pre-commit run --all-files
```

This will:
- Install pre-commit hooks
- Activate them for future commits
- Run all checks on your codebase


## üìö Project Details

The project is organized into several Django apps:
- `item`: Manage clothing items
- `outfit`: Manage group of items
- `order`: Manage orders
- `hanger`, : Manage connected hander

### API Endpoints

The API exposes endpoints for managing items, orders, and more. Example endpoints:

- `/api/items/` ‚Äî List and create clothing items
- `/api/orders/` ‚Äî List and manage orders

> The API is based on the Django REST Framework tutorial: [DRF Serialization Tutorial](https://www.django-rest-framework.org/tutorial/1-serialization/)

### üîé API Documentation (Swagger UI)

Interactive API documentation is available at:

```
http://localhost:8000/api/schema/swagger-ui/
```

You can explore and test all endpoints directly from the browser.

## üß™ Running Tests

Before running tests, make sure your database is up to date:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate
```

To run all tests for the project:

```bash
python manage.py test
```

## üó∫Ô∏è Database Schema Visualization with graph_models

To generate a visual graph of your Django models, we use the `django-extensions` package and the `graph_models` command.

### Database Schema

Below is an example of the generated database schema (`db_schema.png`):

<p align="center">
<img width="500" src="db_schema.png" /></p>

### Installation

Install Graphviz from [https://graphviz.org/download/](https://graphviz.org/download/).


### Generate the Model Graph

Run the following command to generate a PNG image of your database schema:

```bash
python manage.py graph_models --pydot -o db_schema.png
```

See the [https://django-extensions.readthedocs.io/en/latest/graph_models.html](documentation) for details.
- `-a` includes all apps.

You can then open `db_schema.png` to view your database schema visually.


## TODO

- Check and validate image upload and serving for items (media support).
- Switch the environment to production mode (update settings, security, etc.).
- Add tests to each API endpoints.
- Adapt the front to use this new API version.
